# Dungeons game
> A simple Dungeons game, developed using Github CodeSpace and the Github Co-Pilot

I wanted to learn a bit Java and at the same time explore how to
use the Github CodeSpaces and Co-Pilot.

So basically I ask questions to the Co-Pilot chat, which create the
code I'm asking for. Pretty darn cool!

# Compile and Run

We are using Maven to build and run the game.

```shell
# Compile
> mvn compile

# Run
> mvn exec:java
```
